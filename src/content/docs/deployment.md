## The idea

Local development asks, “does it run?” Production asks, “can it restart, drain, scale, observe, and keep secrets safe?” Deployment is the set of decisions that turns one healthy process into a responsible fleet member.

## How Elpod provides it

Elpod targets Bun ESM applications. A minimal production shape is:

```dockerfile
FROM oven/bun:1.4.0
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production
COPY package.json bun.lock tsconfig.json ./
RUN bun install --frozen-lockfile --production
COPY src ./src
USER bun
CMD ["bun", "run", "start"]
```

Use `bun run start` or `bun src/main.ts`, not watch mode. Keep `bun.lock` in the release context, run as a non-root user, and do not copy `.env` files or development dependencies into the image.

Expose health routes and configure the orchestrator to use `/health/live` for liveness and `/health/ready` for readiness. Give the process a termination grace period long enough for native Elysia, request scopes, queues, and providers to drain.

## Production boundary

Elpod provides explicit composition, DI/lifecycle ownership, native HTTP hooks, request identity, structured errors, health routes, diagnostics, and adapters. Your application/deployment still owns:

- database driver, schema, migrations policy, backups, and credentials;
- durable queues, event brokers, outbox storage, and distributed idempotency;
- distributed cache, locks, rate limiting, and brute-force state;
- identity provider, key rotation, MFA, authorization, and tenant isolation;
- OpenTelemetry SDK/exporters, log retention, alerting, and dashboards;
- TLS termination, network egress, secrets injection, image scanning, and rollout policy.

## Checklist

- Pin Bun, Elpod, Elysia, and lockfile dependencies.
- Run `elpod audit --production --strict` and `elpod doctor --production --strict`.
- Run `elpod seal`, typecheck, tests, and migration checks in CI.
- Validate required environment with `defineConfig()`.
- Configure request limits, security headers, authentication, authorization, CORS/CSRF, and rate limits.
- Use shared stores for every cross-replica guarantee.
- Configure structured logs, metrics, traces, alerts, and sensitive-data redaction.
- Test readiness during drain and provider disposal.

## Common mistakes

- Scaling replicas while leaving caches, locks, rate limits, or queues in memory.
- Running migrations independently on every startup without a shared lock.
- Assuming container non-root settings replace application authorization.
- Deploying an unpinned alpha dependency.
